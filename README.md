A simple implementation of a payment system using the stripe API and node.js. A very simple front end. The value is in the code for the API. Click on the img below to see a vedio of the working code base. Stripe is not the best way to do payments. It is simple and clean but has several short falls. Especilly configured with web stacks flavorted more towards a MEAN configuration. Just an opion and a consideration for archectre and design.
